    description: "The Citroën ë-C4 is the all-electric variant of the third-generation C4, sharing its crossover-inspired design that blends hatchback, SUV, and coupe elements. Built on Stellantis' e-CMP dedicated electric platform, it features a distinctive exterior with a sloping roofline, split-level lighting, and protective body cladding. Power comes from a front-mounted electric motor producing 136 HP (100 kW) and 260 Nm of torque, enabling 0-100 km/h acceleration in approximately 9.7 seconds and a top speed of 150 km/h. The 50 kWh lithium-ion battery is mounted under the floor and provides a WLTP range of approximately 350 km (217 miles). Charging capabilities include support for up to 100 kW DC fast charging, allowing a 0-80% charge in about 30 minutes, while a full charge using a 7.4 kW wallbox takes approximately 7.5 hours. The interior showcases Citroën's 'Advanced Comfort' philosophy with particularly supportive seats, a 10-inch touchscreen infotainment system, digital instrument display, and a unique retractable head-up display. Suspension features Progressive Hydraulic Cushions for exceptional ride quality, a key brand differentiator. The ë-C4 offers three driving modes (Eco, Normal, and Sport) and adjustable regenerative braking levels. As one of the first electric vehicles based on the e-CMP platform, the ë-C4 represents Citroën's initial step in its electrification strategy, offering zero-emission mobility in a distinctive package that bridges multiple vehicle segments."
